first client server like if we want to connect to Facebook first we need toconnect to linux server then we can connect to FB 

And to connect to that we have few protocols like to meet PM.CM will have some type of protocol.Common people have some protocol like that to connect to Fb also we have few set of protocols those are:

Client Server architecture

Networking between computers

1. Network
2. Facebook application

serve --> lawyer serves to us, we are his client

facebook is in Linux server, if problem comes we need to login to server..

https://www.facebook.com 

Protocol: https
Port: 443
IP: DNS IP
Username and password --> authentication
SSH --> Secure shell
Port: 22
IP, Username and password/private-key

Firewall --> checks inbound and outbound traffic(for this user how much access there it validates )


inbound --> incoming traffic --> port number 22, 103.149.59.114
outbound --> outgoing traffic

authentication
==================
1. what you know --> username password
2. what you have --> keys, tokens, authentication, rsa token
3. what you are --> fingerprint, retina, palm, face


lock = public
key = private

key pairs --> public key and private key


1. create key pair
2. create firewall
3. import public key to aws account
4. create server and attach public key
5. attach firewall to server

git bash == putty == super putty == mobaxterm == mac terminal = windows cmd

ssh clients

pwd --> present working directory

User Directory
C:\Users\ramu --> windows format 
/c/Users/ramu --> linux format 

windows --> not case sensitive File == file == File 
Linux --> case sensitive --> File != file no space in linux 

/c/devops/<file-name> == C:\devops\<file-name> 

ssh-keygen -f <file-name>



ssh-rsa long-random-code 

Region --> us-east-1

now we should insert the public key in keypairs in ec2 instace so first create Security goup>SG-name-allow-all >Descripting-allowing all ports from all ips

inbound rule:all traffic and my ipv4 and save the go to keypair import the pubic key pair you generated 

and launch ec2 instance >name>ami select>and t3.micro(for practice)>key pair-existing which we gave>sg-which we gave and launch instance by connecting to terminal

0.0.0.0/0

98.81.70.98, 22, SSH, ec2-user, private-key

ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@98.81.70.98

OS --> Redhat, Ubuntu, centos, fedore, suse, oracle linux, amazon linux, debian, rocky linux, kali, solaris

Linux is os or not --> Linux is kernel

OS --> to interact with hardware

Kernal --> heart and brain of OS

Kernel + UI == OS

Redhat --> kernel + user interface ==> Redhat OS
Debian --> Linux kernel + UI ==> Debian

99.9% same all Linux distros/flavours

Redhat --> Open source --> code is free
Redhat enterprise RHEL --> support

RHEL = AWS Linux = Centos = Fedora = Rocky Linux = AlmaLinux

command <options> <inputs>

/home/ec2-user --> linux home directory
/c/users/ramu --> windows home directory

cd --> change directory

cd .. --> one step back

ls --> list subdirectories
