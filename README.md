## About This Repository

This repository contains my hands-on practice in AWS and DevSecOps.
I use it to apply what I learn by building, deploying, and troubleshooting
real infrastructure and applications.

## What I Practice Here

- Linux administration and shell scripting
- Infrastructure creation using Terraform
- Configuration management with Ansible
- Docker image creation and best practices
- Kubernetes deployments and scaling
- CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins
- Basic DevSecOps practices such as image scanning and secrets handling

## Tools and Technologies

- Cloud: AWS (EC2, VPC, ALB, Auto Scaling, IAM, Route 53, EKS)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Configuration Management: Ansible
- Containers: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: Jenkins
- DevSecOps: Image scanning, secrets management, IAM best practices
- Monitoring & Reliability: Logs, metrics, basic SRE practices
- OS & Scripting: Linux, Shell scripting

## Why I Created This

I approach this repository as a real-world system build.
I start by setting up components manually to understand how they work,
then gradually automate them using DevOps and DevSecOps practices.

The focus is on:
- Building an application from scratch
- Moving from manual setup to full automation
- Applying cloud, SRE, and security concepts step by step
- Understanding failures, troubleshooting, and improving reliability
