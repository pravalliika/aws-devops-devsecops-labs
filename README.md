## About This Repository

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of AWS and DevSecOps.
I use it to build, deploy, and troubleshoot real infrastructure and
applications in a real-world setup.

## What I Work On Here

- Linux administration and shell scripting
- Infrastructure creation using Terraform
- Configuration management with Ansible
- Docker image creation and best practices
- Kubernetes deployments, scaling, and upgrades
- CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins
- DevSecOps practices such as image scanning and secrets handling

## Tools and Technologies

- Cloud: AWS (EC2, VPC, ALB, Auto Scaling, IAM, Route 53, EKS)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Configuration Management: Ansible
- Containers: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: Jenkins
- DevSecOps: Image scanning, secrets management, IAM best practices
- Monitoring & Reliability: Logs, metrics, basic SRE practices
- OS & Scripting: Linux, Shell scripting

## How This Repository Is Built

I treat this repository as a real-world system build.
I begin by setting up components manually to clearly understand the flow,
dependencies, and failure points. Once the setup is clear, I automate
infrastructure, deployments, and security using DevOps and DevSecOps
practices.

The work here follows a progressive approach:
- Building an application from scratch
- Moving from manual setup to full automation
- Applying cloud, SRE, and security concepts step by step
- Troubleshooting failures and improving system reliability
